Final Deployment Steps

Push All Changes to GitHub:
Ensure that all updated files (app.py, pages/1_ðŸ”‘_Admin.py, models.py, requirements.txt, Dockerfile) are committed and pushed to your repository.
Configure Environment Variables on Render:
Set ADMIN_CODE to your desired secure admin code.
Ensure Persistent Storage:
Verify that the /app/data directory is correctly mounted as a persistent disk on Render.
Deploy:
Render will automatically detect the Dockerfile and build your updated app.
Monitor the build logs for any issues.
Test the Deployed App:
Access the user interface to see all existing locations.
Log in to the admin interface and:
Add a new location.
Delete an existing location.
Confirm that changes persist after restarting the service.
